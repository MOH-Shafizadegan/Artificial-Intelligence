## Ideas / Brain Stormings
- Reinforcement learning: growing a child, learning and understanding, and also voice recognition of animals (signal processing)
- CSP: assigning tasks to TAs regarding their abilities, interests, and the needs
- HMM: the unknown reseaon behind extending/not-extending the deadline by head TA
- Particle Filtering: Robot Navigation
- Bayesian Networks: Cause and Effects in Psychology
- Regression: X=behaviour and attributes of people   |   Y=GPA
- Classification: X=different attibutes of thinking     |    Classes=Nationalities

## TODOs
I kindly request other GitHub members (specially experts in AI) to contribute to this repository so that we can have a more valuable source of AI materials.

- Upload the lecture notes
- Upload useful slides
- Upload Useful assignments and answers
- Add links of useful courses (videos) and their assignments with answers
- The previous suggestion can be converted into a bank of questions that is useful for teaching assisstants to design homeworks
- Add same respositories
