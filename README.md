## Adversarial Search
### What is it?
Adversarial search is like a strategy game between two players, where one player tries to make the best moves to win, while the other player tries to stop them. It's used in things like chess or tic-tac-toe, where you plan your moves while thinking about what your opponent might do to counter your plans.
### What did I implement?
As you can see in the following picture, this is a Game between 2 players (red and blue) to draw the map. There is another rule in the game that we have some walls (drawn in yellow). If a player enters the yellow area, it will draw walls till it enters the yellow area again.
Note that a player defeats when it doesn't have any choice.

I have implemented this game in 3 modes:
- Min-max vs. Min-max
- Min-max vs. Random Walk
- Random Walk vs. Random Walk

And compare the results with each other which you can see in the "main.ipynb" file.

## Local Search
### What is it?
In local search, you begin with a solution and try to make it better by making small changes. It's like trying to find a better route to visit cities one by one in the Traveling Salesman Problem by re-arranging them slightly. You keep doing this until you can't make it any better. It's a way to find a good solution, even if it's not necessarily the best one.

### What did I implement?
As you can see in the picture, we have some cities in beginning and want to travel between them, reaching all cities and get back to the first city again.

I have implemented 3 different algorithms to do that:
#### Hill Climbing

## Ideas / Brain Stormings
- Reinforcement learning: growing a child, learning and understanding, and also voice recognition of animals (signal processing)
- CSP: assigning tasks to TAs regarding their abilities, interests, and the needs
- HMM: the unknown reseaon behind extending/not-extending the deadline by head TA
- Particle Filtering: Robot Navigation
- Bayesian Networks: Cause and Effects in Psychology
- Regression: X=behaviour and attributes of people   |   Y=GPA
- Classification: X=different attibutes of thinking     |    Classes=Nationalities

## TODOs
I kindly request other GitHub members (specially experts in AI) to contribute to this repository so that we can have a more valuable source of AI materials.

- Upload the lecture notes
- Upload useful slides
- Upload Useful assignments and answers
- Add links of useful courses (videos) and their assignments with answers
- The previous suggestion can be converted into a bank of questions that is useful for teaching assisstants to design homeworks
- Add same respositories
